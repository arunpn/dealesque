# TODO

* find all the offers by scraping item detail pages
  get all the data on search
  if considerably slowing things, do it on pick item or when calculating best offer
  TODO make sure no duplicate offers are created in the process
* find shipping options and costs
  if nothing else, use web scraping
  take care to calculate correctly for amazon logged in and not logged in user
* find more items
  current limit is 10
* create a table of merchant offers / items combinations
  so the user can easily see which merchant offers which items

# Amazon API wrapper

Asin is used instead of Vacuum becase it offers nicer and more Ruby like API
E.g. adding to cart is much simpler with Asin gem

# Adding Kindle books to remote shopping cart

Not possible with API currently
There are mentions of using ASIN instead of offer id, but it doesn't work
